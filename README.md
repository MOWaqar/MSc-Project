# MSc Project: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms on Credit Scoring Data

## Acknowledgement!
This project is based on data provided by Home Credit Group for a Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle.com.
Code snippets and EDA ideas are taken from various publically shared kernels on kaggle community.


## Documentation
Please find the report for this project here:
MSc-Project/ReportDrafts/Project Report.pdf

## Prerequisites
Following tools must be installed.

### scikit-learn
'scikit-learn' is a machine learning package for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, analysis and
machine learning.

### python 3
'python3' programming language python 3

### Pandas
A high performance and easy-to-use data strucutures and data analysis library for Python

### LightGBM
A apckage for a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.

## Setup
1. Project Clone this github project. execute in rootfolder: install -r requirements.txt

2. UnZip 'ProjectDataFiles' in root folder. Pay attention to names and folder structure 
of the project otherwise the code might not run correctly.

### All relevant scripts are in the ProjectCode folder. Run the scripts in the following order:
### 1. DataExploration.py
### 2. Data Preperation.py
### 3. Classifiers.py

## Output
The outputs of each script are saved in 'CodeOutputs' folder. Some results are displayed in the 
console.
