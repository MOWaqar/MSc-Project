# MSc Project: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms on Credit Scoring Data

## Acknowledgement!

First, I would like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Steve Uhlig of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. He has allowed this paper to be my own work but steered me in the right the direction whenever he thought I needed it.
I would also like to thank the Kaggle community in general. The level of expertise, guidance and help that can be found on that forum is unparalleled. I have benefited immensely from the discussions and tutorials which helped me implement my code. 
I would also like to acknowledge Home Credit for sharing their data which has made it possible for me to do an analysis. 
I would also like to acknowledge Professor Pasquale Malacaria of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University as the second examiner of this thesis, and I am gratefully indebted for his time.
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my spouse, for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my year of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.

https://github.com/MOWaqar/MSc-Project/blob/master/ReportDrafts/Project%20Report.docx

## Prerequisites
Following tools must be installed.

### scikit-learn
'scikit-learn' is a machine learning package for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, analysis and
machine learning.

### python 3
'python3' programming language python 3

### Pandas
A high performance and easy-to-use data strucutures and data analysis library for Python

### LightGBM
A apckage for a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.

## Setup
1. Project Clone this github project. execute in rootfolder: install -r requirements.txt

2. UnZip 'ProjectDataFiles' in root folder. Pay attention to names and folder structure 
of the project otherwise the code might not run correctly.

### All relevant scripts are in the ProjectCode folder. Run the scripts in the following order:
### 1. DataExploration.py
### 2. Data Preperation.py
### 3. Classifiers.py

## Output
The outputs of each script are saved in 'CodeOutputs' folder. Some results are displayed in the 
console.
